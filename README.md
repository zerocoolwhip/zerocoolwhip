- 👋 Hi, I’m @zerocoolwhip
- 👀 I’m interested in cryptocurrency, programming, online markets, gold, silver, etc...
- :) I also have lots of real world experience, hobbies and a job that is physically demanding. Construction, real estate, etc...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to make a custom Coinbase api bot that performs exactly like I wany it to. I'd prefer it to be geared more towards market-making, than speculating, but that's not easy since I have yet learned to hedge on lesser traded cryptocurrencies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project, but most likely not others, since my programming is amatuer. I did teach myself to program when I was 13, but I've never programmed full-time and most my programming was 10+ years ago. 
- 📫 How to reach me,... umm....hmu @ 'whip@itsjlee.me'
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I've downloaded from GitHub for over a decade, but it wasn't until a few months ago that I learned what git really is and it's purpose. I still didn't start using it right away, but now my program is getting larger and sometimes my updates don't work as the previous version. 
So my main purpose of using git is to keep my work organized, but if someone wants to help...Awesome! I also wonder, is anyone reading this? ALEPH is going to rise another 20%+ in the next couple weeks, if no news comes that will change the trajectory.
